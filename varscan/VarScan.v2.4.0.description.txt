RELEASE NOTES FOR VARSCAN V2.4.0

20-Aug-2015

VarScan v2.4.0 is the first release to VarScan's new home at GitHub, http://dkoboldt.github.io/varscan/
VarScan v2.3.9 and prior releases will persist on SourceForge, as will the support forums and other resources.

VERSION 2.4.0 CHANGES
The major change to v2.4.0 is the implementation of a SmartFileReader class, which addresses a known bug
in Java runtime that could cause VarScan to hang if given an empty input file. Hat tip to Bina Technologies
for contributing this code.

Minor issues addressed in the current release include:
1.) A correction in the way normal_reads2 values are counted when the mutation allele is not observed. Prior
to this fix, a non-reference base would be counted as a variant allele even if it didn't match the actual mutation
allele called in the tumor. Now, only observations of the tumor variant allele will be counted and go into the FET.

2.) Improved parameter-handling logic for two flags (--validation and --strand-filter), which previously were
sometimes considered "turned on" if the user provided them, even if the value provided was a zero.

3.) Catching the rare ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException errors thrown in the copynumber and trio functions when 
VarScan encountered incomplete mpileup columns. 

4.) Addressed a typo-bug for the tumor-purity parameter which only had an effect if the user provided percentage 
values (e.g. 15) rather than fractions (e.g. 0.15).



REMINDER: PLEASE USE THE FALSE POSITIVE FILTER
The scientific basis of this filter is described in the VarScan 2 publication. It will improve
the precision of variant and mutation calling by removing artifacts associated with short-read alignment.
-For somatic mutations, generate bam-readcounts with the Tumor BAM. For LOH and Germline, generate readcounts with the Normal BAM
-For de novo mutations (trio calling), generate readcounts with the child BAM.
The filter requires the bam-readcount utility: https://github.com/genome/bam-readcount

USAGE: java -jar VarScan.jar fpfilter [variant file] [readcount file] OPTIONS
	variant file - A file of SNPs or indels in VarScan-native or VCF format
	readcount file - The output file from bam-readcount for those positions
	***For detailed filtering instructions, please visit http://varscan.sourceforge.net***

	OPTIONS:
	--output-file		Optional output file for filter-pass variants
	--filtered-file		Optional output file for filter-fail variants
	--keep-failures		If set to 1, include failures in the output file

	--min-var-count		Minimum number of variant-supporting reads [4]
	--min-var-freq		Minimum variant allele frequency [0.05]
